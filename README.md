# What does it do?
This is a rust program that uses a random number to calculate two primes.

This is my interpretation of the algorithm described in [Veritasium's](https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium) video about quantum computers. This is one of my first times writing rust code I feel like there is a lot of room to improve.
